Using Floyd's circle algorithm can help us find a circle in a LinkedList. The time complexity is propotional to the nums in that cycle.

core codes:
slowerRunner = sr.next();
fastRunner = fr.next.next();

If they meet with each other in the linkedlist then there is a cycle. Otherwise, there isn't a cycle.
