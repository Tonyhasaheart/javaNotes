1. time complexity for HashMap.get,put,containsKey is all O(1) if the hashcode works perfectly.
2. Iteration time complextiy of HashMap is proportional to capicity rather than size.
3. Arrays.sort(sorted object, lambda expression showing sorting rules)
  example in Leetcode 937
4. String has a method called split:

        String a="Java is better than cpp." ;
        String[] b =a.split(" ",2);
  output : 
  Java
  is better than cpp.
      String[] c = a.split(" ");
  output :
  Java
  is
  better 
  than
  cpp.
